# Defensive Driving Behaviour
Examples of star rated drivers.
# Observations
1. We observed drivers not following a safe distance from vehicles ahead and kept increasing their speeds.
2. We observed drivers not following a safe distance from vehicles ahead but maintaing their speeds.
3. We observed drivers sometimes not following a safe distance from its surrounding vehicles.
4. We observed drivers not following a safe distance from its nearby vehicles but tried to avoid any type of collision by changing their trajectories or increasing speeds.
5. We observed drivers make sure that they avoid any type of collision by changing their speeds or trajectories.
